# Python-Cybersecurity-Basics

## Overview:
The goal of this repo is to create a structured path to rapidly advance my understanding of Python, from the basics, and shift that programming understanding into the Information Security / Cybersecurity space. This path will cover three levels, and will be structure to relevant resources outside of this repo like Pluralsight and StationX. 

### Outline: 
  - Level 1: The Basics
      - Pluarlsight Python Path
          - Python: The Big Picture
          - Python: Getting Started
          - Python: The Fundamentals
      - Git and Github Tutorial for Beginners
       
  - Level 2: Intermediate (the Start of Security Implementation)
      - Pluarlsight: Python Intermediate
          - Python: Beyond the Basics
          - Python & Ethical Hackinng from Scratch (StationX)

  - Level 3: Advancing in I.T. Security Specifics
      - Cybersecurity (Python and WebDev)
      - PyGame (Keylogger and Trojan Test)
      - Book: Mastering Python for Network Security
   
### Projects:
  - Project 1 (5 Mini Projects)
      - Dice Rolling Simulator
      - Guess the Number
      - Mad Libs Generator
      - Text Based Adventure
      - Hangman

  - Project 2 (KeyLogger)
